## Experiment 1: Sports Group Operations

- **Tasks:** Manage student groups (Cricket, Badminton, Football) without duplicates.
- **Language:** Python

---

## Experiment 2: Marks Analysis

- **Tasks:** Analyze FDS marks to find average, highest, lowest, absentees, and highest frequency.
- **Language:** Python

---

## Experiment 3: Library Book Management

- **Tasks:** Remove duplicates, sort by cost, count books costing >500, and copy books costing <500.
- **Language:** Python

---

## Experiment 4: Sorting Student Percentages (Python)

- **Tasks:** Sort percentages using Selection Sort and Bubble Sort, and display the top five scores.
- **Language:** Python

---

## Experiment 5: Sorting Second-Year Percentages (Python)

- **Tasks:**  
  a) Sort percentages using Insertion Sort.  
  b) Sort percentages using Shell Sort and display the top five scores.  
- **Language:** Python

---

## Experiment 6: Sorting Student Percentages (Python)

- **Tasks:** Sort percentages using Quick Sort and display the top five scores.
- **Language:** Python

---

## Experiment 7: Pinnacle Club Membership Management

- **Tasks:** Manage club membership using linked lists (add, delete, count, display, concatenate).  
- **Language:** C++
